Kids VS Parents:

My first game project for 2024!

This is a multiplayer game where you play as a kid or a parent in a big house. In this game there are two main rounds. The first one if you play as a kid you need to annoy the parents to a paint where they want to kill the kids. The parents need to stay kalm and relaxed. When they reach that point the second round starts. If you play as kid your mission is to escape the house or to kill the parents but you do little damage. As a parent your objective is to just kill the kids with objects around the house. There is a hidden key that opens a drawer with a gun inside. If you find the key as a parent you are shown where is that drawer but as a kid you aren't and your hand will by shaky when you hold the gun.
